# My Reading Journal

Hi guys! My name is Ryan. Military for 16 years, NAVY to be precise. Served 16 years overseas. 15 years in Japan and 1 year in Bahrain. Fun fact about me, I used to be a Radio Jock. Fun times. Now I am here learning new skills to become successful and I believe Code Fellows is the right path to be.

What growth mindset is to me no matter what challenges, circumstances, difficulties, just keep pushing. Set your goal and stay in that path. Push through, get back up. Keep learning from every mistakes and failures. You will reach your goal. You will be successful!

## 3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

*1. Family
*2. Get back up when you fall down. Never give up.
*3. Avoid distractions. Stay in the path of your goals. Reach it!
