Hi guys! My name is Ryan. Military for 16 years, NAVY to be precise. Served 16 years overseas. 15 years in Japan and 1 year in Bahrain. Fun fact about me, I used to be a Radio Jock. Fun times. Now I am here learning new skills to become successful and I believe Code Fellows is the right path to be.

## 3 Strengths

*1. Multitasker* - Having worked for the NAVY for 16 years, it is impossible that you will not develop or improve your multitasking skill. Deadlines are short with multiple taskings assigned to you at once, personnel to lead, operation to handle, and mission to complete, I can say that multitasking in a fast paced work environment is one of my best assets.

*2. Decisive* - Being a multitasker I believe also requires to be decisive. It is an ability that I have developed to meet deadlines, accomplish missions, and run a successful operation.

*3. Highly Adaptive* - No matter how difficult the challenge is ahead, being able to adapt to anything just to overcome it, is a trait that I believe I possess. You can also say that I am very teachable and a great listener.

## 3 Areas of Improvement

*1. Conflict Resolution* - An area of myself that I need to improve on. As a person that has worked in a very toxic environment, conflict resolution sometimes is challenging. You have to have the patience and understanding in dealing with personnel with special problems/attitude. Something that I really need to improve on.

*2. Approachability* - For some reason, a lot of people mistakenly assume me for being unapproachable. I guess I need to work on the way I carry myself? I'm really an introvert person so I guess that's why I resonate such an unapproachable aura.

*3. Patience* - Highly need improvement as sometimes I don't have the patience to wait for results if I am tasked to meet deadlines or finish an assigned project. I get frustrated easily if I hit a dead end, being stalled, or anything that will affect my focus on successfully accomplishing the mission.

What growth mindset is to me no matter what challenges, circumstances, difficulties, just keep pushing. Set your goal and stay in that path. Push through, get back up. Keep learning from every mistakes and failures. You will reach your goal. You will be successful!

## 3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

*1. Family*

*2. Get back up when you fall down. Never give up.*

*3. Avoid distractions. Stay in the path of your goals. Reach it!*
