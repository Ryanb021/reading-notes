## Who is Roy Fielding?

Is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project. Fielding works as a Senior Principal Scientist at Adobe Systems in San Jose, California.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

In 1995, Fielding and seven webmasters started the Apache Group to redesign and maintain the public domain HTTP server developed by Rob McCool at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Four years later, the group formed the nonprofit Apache Software Foundation, with Fielding as its first chairman.[Source](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/roy-fielding-stands-protocol#:~:text=In%201995%2C%20Fielding%20and%20seven,Fielding%20as%20its%20first%20chairman.)


## What does a GET do?

GET is an HTTP method for requesting data from the server.

## What does a POST do?

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request.

## What does PUT do?

The HTTP PUT operation is used for a full replacement of an OSLC resource. The PUT method updates both literal properties and local resource properties, and it deletes any local resource properties that are not included in the request.

## What does PATCH do?

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource. PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused). A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource.
