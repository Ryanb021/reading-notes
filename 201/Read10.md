## Types of error [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
Okay, so it's not quite that simple — there are some other differentiators as you drill down deeper. But the above classifications will do at this early stage in your career.

## List of errors i've encountered

Syntax error. Had to re-do my code. ='(
Logic error. Had to ask a friend.
Other errors that I do not know. Had to research research research.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I will be encountering a lot of errors I know in the future, but that should not stop me from reaching my long term goals. Errors can be corrected, and you learn a lot from your errors. Learning comes from that.

## The JavaScript debugger [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

## Breakpoint

One of the most important debugging techniques in your developer's toolbox. You set breakpoints wherever you want to pause debugger execution.

## Call Stack

The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
