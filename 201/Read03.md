## The *Unordered List* element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list. It is used for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

## The *Ordered List* element represents an ordered list of items â€” typically rendered as a numbered list. Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding marker, such as a number or letter. The *ordered list and *unordered list* elements may nest as deeply as desired, alternating between them however you like. [Source](https://github.com/Ryanb021/reading-notes/edit/main/201/Read03.md)

## *NOTE:* By *NESTING* a list, the bullet style will change for the unordered list. Use the unordered list if grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Use ordered list if the order is meaningful such as recipe steps, turn by turn directions, instruction on repairing or performing maintenance to an equipment.
