## Importance of Semantics and why do we need it [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals)

Semantics are relied on everywhere around usâ€”we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be. So, for example, we expect a red traffic light to mean "stop," and a green traffic light to mean "go." Things can get tricky very quickly if the wrong semantics are applied. (Do any countries use red to mean "go"? We hope not.). In a similar vein, we need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance.
