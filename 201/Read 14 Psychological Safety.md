# Read 14: Psychological Safety

## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

-Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.

-Acknowledge your own fallibility.

-Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

With my previous professional setting, I do believe psychological safety was not being practiced. A lot of yelling, cussing, demands, all those stuff that will make a weka minded person go insane. It's something that needs to be evaluated and changed as we are people. Not animals.

## What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Higher levels of performance and lower levels of interpersonal conflict. It's important to note that not all team members hold the same perceptions. Achieve better results and higher job satisfaction. Teams innovates faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.
