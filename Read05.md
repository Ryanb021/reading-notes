If building a website was fun but challenging at the same time, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will give life and beauty to your website. Successfully creating a site was a great feeling at first, but everytime you look at it, you realize that it's really not that great. But with CSS, you'll be able to clean, beautify, color, or whatever you want to do with your website to make it more appealing and attract audience. From styling text, background color, borders, and etc., you can do whatever you want. As long as you know the commands and where to place them for it to successfully apply to your page. If, not, just like me, you'll be spending hours trying to find what you are doing wrong. But it the end, once you get the hang of it, it's fun!
