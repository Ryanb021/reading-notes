##The Coder's Computer

A topic that is an important learning resource specially for individuals who are just starting to learn the field of programming. It basically explains that the command line interface as one of the main advantage as a tool for programmers as it allows users to type in commands that will generate immediate results. Once you get familiar with the command lines program, it will easily be a quick and simple method in completing and achieving tasks required.

Base on my experience, I guess I was a bit challenged in installing all the important programs using the terminal. There were moments taht I was really frustrated as I have followed the steps carefully but still did not get the result that was supposed to generate. Multiple times I had to re-do an installation, finish the entire installation only to find out at the verification part that most of it did not successfully install. Made me think that staying up late with all that effort was for nothing. But I realized that with all those things I've gone through, I was learning. I am failing but I was learning. And I know eventually it will only make me better. I also thought that this will be easy as I have learned Python before, only to find out this is a different challenge. I was frustrated, and still frustrated. But I am learning, and also late for assignment submission.

- More shortcuts maybe?
