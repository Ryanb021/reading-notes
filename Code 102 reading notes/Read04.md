Add, Push, Commit. Also pull. These are some of the terms I learned in order to properly use the Terminal (Ubuntu) with the program Git. So what is Git? Not really sure but from my understanding, it stores data made up of snapshots. Whatever that means. But from my experience, whenever I commit to any changes in my project, it syncs to Github site where my files are stored or kept. So I gues it's like a middle man for two programs to fully sync, which VS code is the other program that is in sync with Github. Oh and by the way, I also learned that Git and Github are not the same program. Git is the sport, Github is the Arena just to be clear with the explanation. It's a little bit challenging using the Terminal as you can only type and use the arrow keys. and it took me 5 hours just to install all the needed programs for the terminal to work properly.

## Acronyms that I have learned

PWD - print working directory

CD - change directory

ls - list

APC - Add, push, commit? Not sure.

I also learned that the shortcut for copy and paste in the terminal is CTRL+SHIFT+C for copy and CTRL+SHIFT+V for paste. I still have a lot to learn so I'll keep on reading resources so I can be proficient in this program.
