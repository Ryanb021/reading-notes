## 3 major parts of what we usually refer to as "JavaScript"

1. The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.


2. The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.DOM API
