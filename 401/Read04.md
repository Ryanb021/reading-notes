## Data Modeling

## What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

- SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. 

## What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL database is better suited for hierarchical data storage because it follows the key-value pair method or graph method. NoSQL databases are highly preferred for large data sets.

## Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

- To a non technical friend I would say, SQL is like a ladder. You can only use it up and down, vertically. NOSQL is like the horizon, you can only traverse it horizontally. SOunds about right.

## Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

- A one-to-many relationship is the most common kind of relationship. In this kind of relationship, a row in table A can have many matching rows in table B. But a row in table B can have only one matching row in table A.

## Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

- Create a diagram.

## Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

- A primary key uniquely identifies a row in a table, while a foreign key is used to link two tables together by referencing the primary key of the related table.

## How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

- When creating a procedure and declaring a parameter name, the parameter name must begin with a single @ character and must be unique in the scope of the procedure. Keywords can be used as identifiers by placing them between [ ] (square brackets).

## Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

- In normalization, columns are assigned to tables in such a way that each business fact is stored only once, or in other words, a table should not contain duplicate data.

## Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

- To a non-techinical recrruiter, I would say, one to one relationship is like relationship in life. Monogamy. Stick to one only. One to many is a player, one person having multiple realtionship at once. Many to many is probably something inappropriate to say. Individuals in a gorup is having relationships to individuals in another group.
