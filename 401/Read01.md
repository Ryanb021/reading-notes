## Node Ecosystem

## How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

- Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications. I probably would explain it as in cooking. Node are like the cooking materials such as pots and pans, knives, cutting boards, whisk, and all that cooking items. Without it, you cannot start or complete your recipe.

## What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
