# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- To make the best choice possible, we have to consider how the data structure will be used and how often.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- Infinite recursion is avoided by ensure that progress is made toward the basis case or cases in every recursive call.
