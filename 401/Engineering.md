# Engineering Reading

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- The one thing that I believe I bring to this carrer and my potential employer is that I am teachable. I hunger for knowledge, I do not act like I am better than anyone, I do not act like I know everything, I will stay humble. I will be like a sponge and absorb everything that I can learn from my peers.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Need to be open and ask for help everytime I get stuck.

- Take a break and refresh my thinking. If need be, sleep it off.

- Be humble.
