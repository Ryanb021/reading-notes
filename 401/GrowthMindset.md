# Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your skills with deliberate practice

- Upon reading this article, I was able to relate to it so much. I am at an entry level knowledge as a software developer and most of the time I am frustrated as I don't get the results that I wanted and I feel like I do not know anything yet in this field. I felt so behind and incompetent at times. Reading this article somewhat enlightened me as I know eventually I will progress and be the best at what I do. But it will not be that easy. It takes practice, challenging yourself, and keep determination in finding solution. Like the article said, creating or developing software/app will not make you a better programmer. Practicing and challenging yourself in solving complex problems will make you a better programmer. It also mentioned that programmers' highest rate of learning was at the beginning of their career. I need to keep myself in that mindset. No matter how I get better at some proficiency, I need to keep practicing and challenging myself and my skill set. If I want to be the best, I need to to be at my highest rate of learning.

## Carol Dweck on growth mindset

- This video article is really great. I really enjoyed watching and understanding the meaning of yet, not yet, effort, growth mindset, and a lot of terms that I can really relate to. It really gave be motivation, and more understanding that failing is not the end of everything. You have to pursue, give your best effort, learn, engage, and challenge yourself. Do not compare yourself to others as you will eventually reach the point of your best self. Mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Progress and learn by your efforts. It's never too late. It's not always about the now. It's about the effort, working hard, and long enough.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- The ability to learn is not fixed. It can change with your effort. We need to accept failure, we need to accept to be wrong in order to be successful. We need to be grittier. Follow through with our commitments or plans. This video was also amazing. It's not always about the talent, or IQ. You can be successful by being gittier than others. Never stop and keep pursuing your plans and dreams. It's for the long run, not the now.

## Alain de Botton on redefining success

- Success is not something that you reach—not something that is outside of yourself, just down the field. Success is creating a life you want to live in right now. A successful life is one in which your basic needs for food, shelter, health care, and income are met and in which you have a sense of autonomy, mastery, and belonging. A life that is not about enduring means you can’t stand in order to reach ends you are supposed to want; but rather, about selecting pursuits based on how much you’ll enjoy the process of doing them. After all, it is the process that makes up most of your life. End results, good or bad, are ephemeral. But the process? That’s how you spend your days, months, and years. That’s what really matters.

## My emotional intelligence

- In performing the emotional intelligence scoring tool, I can conclude that my realtionship management needs improvement. I did better on self-management and did equally on both self-awarenes and social awareness. I know that I will improve on every aspect eventually. Just my past military experience somewhat developed a mentality that I know will not apply now in the civilian world. I need to be more mindful now of the people around me and be wise about it.

## Assess my biases

- In assessing my biases, the area that I have that is the strongest is Bias and Identity. My weakset is Connect to mitigate bias. And the areas that I will focus on in the coming weeks and beyond is Connect to mitigate bias. At this point of my career, I know that I need a lot of improvements with my biases as it is something that wasn't really given attention to when I was stil active at the military. It is now something that I need to pay attention to as during my time in the military, biases is left and right. and it is not in a good way and it is not something you can you can fight due to the heirarchy of the military. It is now something that I know I can challenge and probably make a difference in a good and better way.
