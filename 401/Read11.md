## Event Driven Applications

## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

- EventEmitter. Node. js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away

## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

- Object oriented programming focuses on performing actions and manipulation of data that is encapsulated in objects within a sequential series of steps while event driven is more dynamic and relies on event triggering and event handling to determine the sequencing of the program.

## Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

- If I would explain Event Driven Programming to a non-technical friend, I would say that it's like it's like a checklist of a delivery for let's ay produce. Before delivery, you need a vendor, and you have requirements from the vendor about their product before buying and being delivered. Such as temperature of delivery when arriving, price, days from being harvested, and all that stuff. Once you agreed to those requirements, it needs to be met for delivery and arrival. What day and time and return policy. I guess that's how I will explain it to him.
