## Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

- Middleware if I would explain it as a non-technical recruiter, I would say it's like the middleman between a customer and the customer's purpose. Like say an individual wants to buy cocaine from a drug dealer. He won't be able to buy it directly from the drug dealer due to identity and security issues, so a middleman will be the one to offer and sell the individual the drugs. It's the middleman who is the  handler that makes the transaction possible. I guess I could say the same for middleware.

## Express the most popular __ __ ____.

- Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.

## Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

- It means there is no one right way to do things that Express will force you into.

## What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- Module or modularity allows development to be divided by splitting down a program into smaller programs in order to execute a variety of tasks. This enables us developers to work simultaneously and minimizes the time taken for development.

## What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- 9.5.1

## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

- npm install jshint

## Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- If I should explain it to my non-technical elder, I would say or compare it to STD or HIV test. If you don't get tested, how would you know if you are STD/HIV free and can go out there and spread your children. You may think you are healthy but you won't know unless you get tested. Same with testing your code before deployment. It may seem good to look at your codes but will it run properly or pass the test?

## What are three expected benefits of testing

- Many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort
- The same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
- Although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling

## Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

*Individual Pitfalls*
- Forgetting to run tests frequently
- Writing too many tests at once

*Team Pitfalls*
- Partial adoption. Only a few developers on the team use TDD.
- Poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time.

## What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- Continuous Integration (CI) allows you to continuously integrate code into a single shared and easy to access repository. Continuous Delivery (CD) allows you to take the code stored in the repository and continuously deliver it to production. CI/CD creates a fast and effective process of getting your product to market before your competition as well as releasing new features and bug fixes to keep your current customers happy.

## What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- Continuous delivery automates deployment of a release to a staging or testing environment, while continuous deployment automatically deploys every release to production after it passes through your pipeline, including testing.

## Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.

- I would probably compare it to the military. Continuous delivery is like recruitment and military bootcamp. Keep recruiting and send them to bootcamp to test them and see who will remain to qualify and stay. Continuous deployment would be thsoe who graduated bootcamp and ready to be given orders and deploy to their next duty station to perform their duties.
