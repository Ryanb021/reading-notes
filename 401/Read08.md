## Access Control (ACL)

## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
- 
## Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- A simple example of hierarchical RBAC is a series of roles, in which each role inherits the permissions of the previous one, and adds more permissions: Guest user – limited permissions. Regular user – same permissions as guest user and more. Power user – same permissions as regular user and more.
- 
## What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role Based Access Control (RBAC), and Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
- 
## If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- Authorization is any mechanism by which a system grants or revokes the right to access some data or perform some action. Often, a user must log in to a system by using some form of authentication.
- 
## Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.

- The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.
- 
## Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

-  RBAC if I would explain it to a non-technical friend is like working at McDonald's. If you are assigned as cashier, you only take care of cashier services like customer orders and proper collection of money and change given. If you are the trash and dishwasher, that's all you can do. You cannot cook or cashier. That simple.
-  
## What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.

- Access Rights are the permissions an individual user or a computer application holds to read, write, modify, delete or otherwise access a computer file; change configurations or settings, or add or remove applications.
- 
## Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?

- Once the user successfully authenticates, we will then use authorization to ensure the user can only access their systems and data.

## Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.

- With RBAC, companies can decrease the need for paperwork and password changes when they hire new employees or switch the roles of existing employees. RBAC lets organizations quickly add and change roles, as well as implement them across platforms, operating systems and applications.
