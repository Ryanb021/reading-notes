## Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

- Serverless if I had to explain it to a non-techinical friend, would be like remote work. You are working from home and you don't have a boss or someone to manage you. But you still have a boss or manager remotely to report to.

## What is a CDN?

- A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

## How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

- To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website's server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.

## What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

- Web applications use CDNs largely because they offer four important benefits: better performance, increased reliability, cost savings, and resilience against cyber attacks.
