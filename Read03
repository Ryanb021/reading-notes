# Structure Web Pages with HTML

Learning the HTML program was fun. It basically teaches you the skills and gives you the tools to build up a website using your creativity. But before jumping into creating one, it requires brainstorming and teamwork to successfully create an attractive and working website. You have to communicate with your team and build a framework manually, like a drawing board to base all the things that will be finalized for the website. It will be a challenge though once you jump to the program and start writing the code. I've learned that Semantics, like headers, main, section. Terms that will be important in the application. Opening and closing tags, footers, and etc. It was really challenging but once you see the final result, it's a bit rewarding. You will realize that you could have done more or made it better. But good thing that you can always go back and change it.
